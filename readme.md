# Giphy Movie Scene Searcher

### Overview

Giphy Movie Scene Search is a simple API scraper which retrieves movie scenes from the Giphy API based on search terms entered by the user. Returned scenes are filtered such that as many work-inappropriate scenes are passed over as possible given current technology.


### A Few Things to Remember:

* Submitting search terms via the header's text bar adds those terms to the group of terms already existing as buttons.

* Clicking on terms' buttons will elict a limited content response from Giphy in the form of movie scene gifs which can be paused and unpaused via clicking.

* Additional search term button clicks will add any additional incoming gifs to the top of the list already accumulated.
